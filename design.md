# Some thoughts on game design...

This game isn't made by a profession developer, just by your local idiot birb. So, this game will probably not be designed well, and that's okay!

Anywho.

## Combat

The game's combat will work on probabilities. It's vaguely inspired by MagicTheNoah's slides-games, where he uses wheels to determine the outcome of events. As such, things will stay pretty simple, but there will be *some* more complexity than present in Noahgames since they are more comedic than good.

Power is split into two values, ranged power and melee power. All attacks are a contest of attacker's relevant power stat versus the target's defense. Defense can be agility, physical hardiness, whatever- It doesn't matter, this isn't trying to be Warhammer. Melee power works in melee, but to get to melee one of two things needs to happen. Either the attacker and target both want to engage in melee willingly, or the attacker needs to successfully close the distance. Characters have a speed stat, and a contest of speed determines if the target is in melee that turn. If in melee, the attacker uses melee power- if not, then ranged. The relavant power is always used reguardless of the AI's strategy, but someone going for melee probably has a higher melee power than ranged.
